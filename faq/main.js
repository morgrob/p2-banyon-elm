/* 
 * The link where I got this code snippet is listed in the credits section of the site. This code takes all 
 * of my elements with the class name "accordion", and creates a function where if one of them is clicked, it will 
 * use the maxHeight function to open and close the accordion items. If the panel has a max height, it is nullified. 
 * If there is no max height, the panel is assigned "scrollHeight", which is the height of the content.
