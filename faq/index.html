          Banyon Elm is a new American news company targeted mostly towards
          younger audiences. We provide you with the most important news
          throughout the day, and we place a special emphasis on pop culture
          happenings and how we can best tackle climate change, as those are
          topics that younger audiences are attracted to.

      <button class="accordion">Is Banyon Elm a reliable source?</button>
      <div class="panel">
        <p>
          Yes, Banyon Elm is reliable. We check each detail of our stories
          diligently before publishing to ensure that we never spread false
          information. Like everyone, we do occasionally make mistakes. In these
          cases, we always issue an apology and correct the mistake immediately.

      <button class="accordion">What is the process of publishing news?</button>
      <div class="panel">
        <p>
          We have teams assigned to each of our news sections. When an event
          occurs, the team quickly assigns it to the person most equipped to
          write about it. That person will then cover the event as objectively
          as possible, they will pass it on to the first round of editors who
          will scour for errors or improvements to be made, and those editors
          will then pass the story on to the second round of editors who will do
          the same with fresh eyes. Finally, the story will be passed to one of
          our chief editors who will give the final stamp of approval.
